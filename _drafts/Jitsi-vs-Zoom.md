Today I finished my [Pluralsight](https://www.Pluralsight.com) trial and removed my account. Pluralsight cut me off after about 173 min of videos even though they said 200min or 10 days, whichever comes first. Maybe they counted time from rewinding and rewatching the videos. I am counting the time lengths of all videos I watched. So I still recommend the free trial but don't do more than one course or you won't be able to go as deep into a video series. And [I still recommend their service]({%- post_url 2020-04-05-back-to-school -%}) because they have a large amount of good content on many technical topics. Just letting people know what to expect.

I also reviewed Oracle Java CAPS tutorial on Keytool and OpenSSL, a valuable resource for my previous project, Secure Chat Server 1.

I am looking into using MonoDevelop for Secure Chat Server 2 since it seems like the best IDE for Linux users that is equivalent to Visual Studio.
