## Publishing my first app to the Apple App Store

I have begun to work on my app, *Mancala World* (working title), full time to become an iOS developer. I began working on this app in my spare time on the weekends and even sometimes when I came home after work. As a software developer, my colleagues couldn't understand why I wanted to program in my free time. It's because this is my passion project and I actually enjoy working on it.

The week prior I spent completing the animations on the AI progress bar and making sure that the array of saved game data is saved to disk when the player switches to Online Game mode. I still want to make the AI smarter, but it is good enough for now.

The goal in the next week is to upload my first build to TestFlight for beta testing.
