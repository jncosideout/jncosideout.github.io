This site is maintained by me, Alex Beaty, an iOS developer. Its purpose is to allow users to get in contact with me if they experience problems, desire new features or want to ask questions about my apps.

It's also home to my blog and a showcase for my portfolio. You will find content here detailing my day-to-day growth in my profession and technical skills, as well as tidbits from my life, but not many, I'm keeping it professional here ;) .

If you have found a bug for this app, or would like to suggest new features or improvements, [please do so here].
